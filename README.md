In this project you'll have two screens (Activities).
First screen is basically a BMI calculator, you enter your name, height, weight and gender. Pressing the calculate button would show the BMI result in the text field. Also there's a remember checkbox which if checked would save the info of the person in the shared preferences.
A button at the bottom of the first screen would navigate the user to the second screen which is a timer. 
The way the timer works is you have three EditTexts, one for hours, one for minutes and another for seconds. The default value for each EditText is 0 so that the user can choose not to put a number in it.
When the start button is pressed, the activity takes the values for the EditTexts and put them in the TextField below it and starts counting down to 0. When the timer reaches 0, it simply stops.
There's also a pause and stop button which pauses and resets the timer respectively
